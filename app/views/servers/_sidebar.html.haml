      %h2 How does ServerMonitoringHQ collect information ?
      %p 
        We SSH into your server on a regular basis and run a number of commands e.g. 
        %code
          cat /proc/loadavg. 
        We don't run any commands that change anything on your server we only read information.  
      %p
        We 
        %em
          don't need a root 
        account to collect information. A standard user account is sufficient, you can create an account for ServerMonitoringHQ e.g. 
        %code
          adduser servermonitoringhq
      %p
        All passwords are encrypted and we also encrypt private key information and keep this secure for obvious reasons.
